🧑🏻‍💻 Staff sofware engineer with experience in the devtools space. Since 2017 I work at [Rainforest QA][rainforest-web] and scale the vision-based automated testing offering.

Outside of work, I maintain the [undercover][undercover-gh] Ruby Gem and [UndercoverCI Github App][undercover-ci] and write about it on [Medium][mrgrodo-medium]. I also love to spend time outside on the [road bicycle][strava-jan].
