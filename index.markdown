🧑🏻‍💻 I am sofware engineer with experience in devtools and automation. Currently building accessible no-code quality assurance at [Rainforest QA][rainforest-web].

Outside of work, I maintain the [undercover][undercover-gh] Ruby Gem and [UndercoverCI Github App][undercover-ci] and write about it on [Medium][mrgrodo-medium]. I also love to spend time outside on the [road bicycle][strava-jan].
