Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer with an interest and experience in building developer tools.

I currently work as Staff Engineer at [Rainforest QA][rainforest-web]. I build and maintain the [undercover][undercover-gh] Ruby Gem and [Github App][undercover-ci] and write about it on [Medium][mrgrodo-medium]. I love to spend my free time outside, most often on the [road bicycle][strava-jan].
